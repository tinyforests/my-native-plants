/**
 * REG canonical ecological-context schema.
 *
 * Deliberately a SUPERSET of the resolver schema already locked on 15 Aug 2026
 * (system / code / name / resolution / source / status) so fmeg, fmevc and fmnp
 * remain drop-in readers. No parallel schema is introduced.
 *
 * STATUS VOCABULARY — two values only, unchanged from the locked decision:
 *   'ok'      the dataset was queried and returned a classification
 *   'nodata'  the dataset was queried and returned nothing for this point
 *
 * A capability that was NOT queried (unsupported in this jurisdiction, or not
 * yet implemented) is ABSENT from ecological_context entirely. Absence and
 * 'nodata' are different facts and must stay distinguishable:
 *
 *   key absent          -> we did not ask
 *   status: 'nodata'    -> we asked, there is no coverage here
 *   status: 'ok'        -> we asked, here is the answer
 *
 * Zero is never written for any of these. Nothing in this module can emit 0
 * as a placeholder.
